# space_elevator

This website is a showcase for the "Space elevator project". 
I really like the idea and I hope some day we can take the elevator to the stars.
I made this website to show my 2d graphical skills as well as my front end programming skills.
If you like to know more about me visit my portfolio website at http://www.slave-angelovski.com/.

This site was made with jQuery at first but I converted it to java script to gain performance on a certain mobile devices.
I have also included throttling to reduce the execution rate of the on scroll event listeners.
