				<h2>Ground station</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">Modern concepts for the base station/anchor are typically mobile stations, large oceangoing vessels or other mobile platforms. Mobile base stations would have the advantage over the earlier stationary concepts (with land-based anchors) by being able to maneuver to avoid high winds, storms, and space debris. Oceanic anchor points are also typically in international waters, simplifying and reducing cost of negotiating territory use for the base station.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info elevator1">
				<h2>Elevator</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">
				A space elevator cannot be an elevator in the typical sense (with moving cables) due to the need for the cable to be significantly wider at the center than at the tips. While various designs employing moving cables have been proposed, most cable designs call for the "elevator" to climb up a stationary cable. The elevator speed would be limited by the Coriolis force, available power, and by the need to ensure the climber's accelerating force does not break the cable. Climbers would also need to maintain a minimum average speed in order to move material up and down economically and expeditiously. At the speed of a very fast car or train of 300 km/h (190 mph) it will take about 5 days to climb to geosynchronous orbit.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info bird">
				<h2>Ruppell's vulture</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">Rüppell's vulture is considered to be the highest-flying bird, with confirmed evidence of a flight at an altitude of 11,300 metres (37,100 ft) above sea level.
					 Once considered common, the Rüppell's vultures are experiencing steep declines. They are relatively slow birds, cruising at 35 kilometres per hour (22 mph), but fly for 6–7 hours every day and will fly as far as 150 kilometres (93 mi) from a nest site to find food.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info plane">
				<h2>Spy plane</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">A reconnaissance aircraft is a military aircraft designed, or adapted, to carry out aerial reconnaissance. Their roles are to collect imagery intelligence, signals intelligence, and measurement and signature intelligence. Aerial reconnaissance was mostly carried out by versions of standard fighters and bombers equipped with cameras. Today, much of the strategic role has passed over to satellites, and the tactical role to unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info baloon">
				<h2>Weather baloon</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">A weather or sounding balloon is a balloon (specifically a type of high-altitude balloon) which carries instruments aloft to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed by means of a small, expendable measuring device called a radiosonde. To obtain wind data, they can be tracked by radar, radio direction finding, or navigation systems (such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System, GPS). Balloons meant to stay at a constant altitude for long periods of time are known as transosondes.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info meteor">
				<h2>Meteor</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">A meteor, known colloquially as a "shooting star" or "falling star", is the visible passage of a glowing meteoroid, micrometeoroid, comet or asteroid through Earth's atmosphere, after being heated to incandescence by collisions with air molecules in the upper atmosphere, creating a streak of light via its rapid motion and sometimes also by shedding glowing material in its wake. Although a meteor may seem to be a few thousand feet from the Earth, meteors typically occur in the mesosphere at altitudes from 76 to 100 km (47 to 62 mi). Meteors become visible between about 75 to 120 km (47 to 75 mi) above Earth. They usually disintegrate at altitudes of 50 to 95 km (31 to 59 mi).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info aurora">
				<h2>Aurora borealis</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">An aurora sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly in the form of electrons and protons, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere) due to Earth's magnetic field, where their energy is lost.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info iss">
				<h2>International station</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. The ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and other fields. The station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the Moon and Mars. The ISS maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km (205 and 270 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft. It completes 15.54 orbits per day.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info elevator2">
				<h2>Space elevator</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">To construct a space elevator on Earth the cable material would need to be both stronger and lighter (have greater specific strength) than any known material. Development of new materials which could meet the demanding specific strength requirement is required for designs to progress beyond discussion stage. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been identified as possibly being able to meet the specific strength requirements for an Earth space elevator. Other materials considered have been boron nitride nanotubes, and diamond nanothreads, which were first constructed in 2014.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info satellite">
				<h2>Satellite</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">A satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit. Such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. Since 1957, about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched. According to a 2013 estimate, 3,600 remained in orbit. Of those, about 1,000 were operational, while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris. Approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 50 are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000 km), and the rest are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000 km)</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info spy-sat">
				<h2>Spy satellite</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">A reconnaissance satellite (commonly, although unofficially, referred to as a spy satellite) is an Earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications. There are several major types of reconnaissance satellites: missile early warning, nuclear explosion detection, photo surveillance, electronic-reconnaissance, signals intelligence and sattelites for radar imaging.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info space-station">
				<h2>Space station</h2>
				<p class="mCustomScrollbar">A space station, also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station, is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers, which is designed to remain in space (most commonly as an artificial satellite in low Earth orbit). The space station will be used as an anchour for the space elevator, using the forces of gravity, which are stronger at the lower end, and the outward/upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth. With the tether deployed, elevators could repeatedly climb and descend the tether by mechanical means.</p>
